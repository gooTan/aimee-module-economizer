/* gateway_mutate_wire.h: the buffered request-path ORCHESTRATION for economizer
 * gateway mutation (proposal §2.5, buffered). Sits above the pure decision helpers
 * (gateway_mutate.h): resolves the per-session key from the thread-local request
 * identity, honors the per-session circuit breaker, snapshots + reduces + replaces
 * the messages array under the aggressive-tier live gateway mutation, and after the
 * upstream status handles the 4xx-restore-resend / 5xx-disable contract. Shared by
 * the Anthropic (/v1/messages) and OpenAI (/v1/responses) buffered paths. Provider-
 * agnostic: it operates on a cJSON `container` and the message-array `key` within
 * it, so restore/replace touch exactly the array the provider body is built from. */
